# 🐍 SnakeGame
**By Jonasthepanda**

## 📝 Description
Welcome to **SnakeGame**, a project developed for a school assignment. In this take on the Snake game, you control a growing snake, collecting fruits and avoiding collisions with yourself or the walls. I’ve put my own spin on it with unique features like multiple difficulty levels, custom designs, and even a nightmare mode for the brave souls that don't know any better!

## 🎮 Features
- **Customizable Boards & Snakes**: Choose from multiple designs and styles.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Start easy or dive straight into *Nightmare Mode* for a real challenge.
- **Highscores**: Keep track of your top scores and beat your own records.
- **Fruit Variety**: Different fruits with unique designs.
- **QoL Improvements**: Smooth snake movements and enhanced gameplay experience.

## 🔧 Current Tasks & Future Plans
- [X] Implement board creation function
- [X] Add snake movement
- [X] Create start game functionality
- [X] Add snake food (fruits)
- [X] Points system
